## **React App Task: Multi-File Upload with Concurrent Handling**

You are required to develop a simple React application that allows users to drag and drop multiple files into the UI and upload them concurrently. The application should display a file list with the upload status for each file (e.g., uploading, success, failure). The upload process should support concurrency handling, meaning multiple files can be uploaded simultaneously. You are free to use any mock or actual API for the upload functionality.

As part of this task, we would like you to make thoughtful decisions regarding how you handle state management in React. Choose the most appropriate approach for managing the state of the file uploads (whether it be hooks, context, or another React-specific method), and explain your reasoning behind your choice.

The UI should be styled using Material-UI (MUI) components to provide a clean, responsive design.

The key aspects we are looking for are:

- Efficient handling of concurrent file uploads.
- Clean and maintainable code.
- A clear, well-explained choice for state management.
- Use of MUI for styling and responsiveness.

Feel free to add any additional features or improvements you think would enhance the user experience.
